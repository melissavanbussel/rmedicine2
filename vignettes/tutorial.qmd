# This is a Quarto document

Which means you can run R and Python code, and use Quarto chunk options.

Here is R code, including from the current package: 

```{r}
print_hello_world(x = "Hello")
```

You can also include Python code (remember to add `reticulate` to `extra-packages` in the GitHub workflow):

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can include math as well: 

$$
x^2 + y^2 = 9
$$

Some features, like callouts, don't work properly, but still look ok:

## Warning

This is a warning.
